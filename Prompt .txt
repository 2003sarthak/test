Create a workflow diagram for a project titled "Commercial Vehicle Insurance Broker Portal". The workflow should visually represent the end-to-end process of how a broker interacts with the system. Use a clean, modern flowchart or step-by-step style with arrows and labeled components. The workflow should include the following steps:

Broker Login / Registration

Dashboard Access

Create New Quote
– Form submission
– Premium calculation via rating API
– View premium breakdown

Submit Quote
– Quote status: Pending

Quote Approval Process
– Admin reviews and updates status to Approved

Generate PDF of Final Quote
