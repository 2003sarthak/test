**Figma Design Prompt: Broker Portal Web Application**

---

**Project Overview:**
Design a responsive web application for an insurance company’s Broker Portal that allows brokers to perform various operations such as obtaining insurance quotes, managing insurance policies, and reviewing a rating system for quotes. The application should maintain a user-friendly interface with streamlined workflows for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and smooth navigation. The target users are insurance brokers in the US, with a focus on P&C (Property and Casualty) insurance for 1–2 states.

**Design Requirements:**

1. **Overall Look and Feel:**
   - Professional, clean, and modern design. Use neutral tones (e.g., white, gray, and light blue) with accents for action buttons (e.g., primary CTA buttons in navy or green).
   - Typography: Use a clean and accessible font (e.g., Open Sans, Roboto).
   - Focus on usability and accessibility with WCAG compliance.

2. **Key Pages and Components:**

   **1. Quote Form Page (New Submission):**
   - A well-structured form to collect data for insurance quotes with sections for common and Line-of-Business (LoB)-specific inputs.
   - Dynamic premium calculation: Display premium updates in real-time as parameters are changed. Include a highlighted summary of the final quote and rating before submission.
   - Design clear and distinguishable action buttons: “Submit Quote,” “Reset Fields,” and “Preview Premium.”
   - Include form validations (e.g., error tooltips and input hints).
   - Sample inputs for Cyber Insurance (1–2 states).

   **2. Quote List Page:**
   - Paginated table view of all quotes submitted with sortable columns for Quote ID, Customer Name, Submission Date, Premium, and Status.
   - Row actions for “View,” “Edit,” “Soft Delete,” and “Submit for Bind” with hover-over effects.
   - Filters and search bar for quotes based on status, LoB, or time range.
   - Show visual indicators for action statuses (e.g., colored badges for “In Review,” “Bound,” or “Deleted”).

   **3. Quote Details Page:**
   - A detailed view of the quote, including all input parameters and the premium breakdown.
   - Separate sections for rating parameters used during submission.
   - Include a "readonly" mode if the quote has been submitted for binding or soft-deleted.

   **4. Rating Component:**
   - A pop-up modal or sidebar integrated into the Quote Form for rating calculations.
   - Adjustable sliders/dropdowns for rating parameters with visual indicators (e.g., percentage or numeric values).
   - Provide a preview of the calculated premium dynamically updated based on parameter changes.

   **5. Authentication Screens:**
   - Design a simple login page with OAuth or DB-based authentication.
   - Include branding elements such as the company logo.

**Other Design Considerations:**
- Design must be responsive and adapt gracefully to both desktop (Chrome/Edge) and mobile devices.
- Incorporate loading indicators, error handling UI (e.g., “Something went wrong”), and success notifications.
- Consistently use tooltips or help icons to explain complex inputs.
- Ensure the navigation bar clearly highlights the current page (Quote Form, Quote List, etc.).
- Add footer with legal disclaimers and links (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service).
